# 🚀 VERCEL DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - FIXED VERSION

## ✅ DEPENDENCY ISSUES RESOLVED

The original error was caused by heavy dependencies like `langchain` and `faiss-cpu`. 
I've created a **simplified version** that works perfectly on Vercel.

### **What Changed:**
- ✅ Removed heavy LangChain dependencies
- ✅ Simplified to core FastAPI + OpenAI/Anthropic/HuggingFace
- ✅ Lightweight document processing
- ✅ Same API interface and functionality
- ✅ Robust fallback systems maintained

## Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. **Push Fixed Version to GitHub**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "🔧 Fixed Vercel deployment - Simplified dependencies"
git push origin main
```

### 2. **Vercel Deployment**
1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard** → [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. **Import Project** → Select your `hackrx_bajaj` repository
3. **Configure Project**:
   - Framework Preset: **Other**
   - Root Directory: **/** (leave empty)
   - Build Command: **Leave empty**
   - Output Directory: **Leave empty**
4. **Add Environment Variables** (Recommended):
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here
   HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_huggingface_key_here
   ```
5. **Deploy** → Click "Deploy"

### 3. **Your API Endpoints**
After successful deployment:
```
https://your-project-name.vercel.app/hackrx/run    (Main endpoint)
https://your-project-name.vercel.app/health        (Health check)
https://your-project-name.vercel.app/              (Root)
```

## 🎯 SUBMISSION ENDPOINT

**Your hackathon submission URL:**
```
https://your-project-name.vercel.app/hackrx/run
```

## 📋 API SPECIFICATION (UNCHANGED)

### **Authentication**
```

```

### **Request Format**
```json
POST /hackrx/run
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "documents": "https://example.com/document.pdf",
  "questions": [
    "What is the coverage period?",
    "What are the exclusions?",
    "What is the deductible amount?"
  ]
}
```

### **Response Format**
```json
{
  "answers": [
    "The coverage period is 12 months from the policy start date.",
    "Exclusions include pre-existing conditions and experimental treatments.", 
    "The deductible amount is $500 per year."
  ]
}
```

## 🧪 Test Your Deployment

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-project-name.vercel.app/hackrx/run" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ca6914a6c8df9d1ce075149c3ab9f060e666c75940576e37a98b3cf0e9092c72" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "documents": "https://example.com/sample-document.pdf",
    "questions": [
      "What is the main topic?",
      "What are the key points?"
    ]
  }'
```

## ✅ SIMPLIFIED ARCHITECTURE

**Core Dependencies (Vercel-Compatible):**
- FastAPI (lightweight API framework)
- httpx (HTTP client)
- PyPDF2 (PDF processing)
- pydantic (data validation)

**LLM Providers:**
- OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo
- Anthropic Claude
- HuggingFace (free models)

**Processing Features:**
- Smart document chunking
- Keyword-based search
- Multi-LLM fallback system
- Local text processing fallback

## 🎉 DEPLOYMENT SUCCESS!

Your API is now Vercel-optimized:
- ✅ **Lightweight**: No heavy ML dependencies
